## RDM 数据

由于 fMRI 和 MEG 的神经影像数据十分昂贵和有限，因此目前只有两组数据，它们的细节如下。

其中， MEG 数据的 RDM 矩阵大小为 $15 \times 20 \times n \times n$ 代表 15 名被试和 20 个时间点，$n$代表图像数量，它包括 78images 和 92images 两组图像；而fMRI 数据与之类似，但只有 1 个时间点。另外，78images 图像为自然场景，其直方图特征较为复杂；92images 图像为分割后的纯粹物体，其直方图特征较为简单。

## RDM 与图像关系

接下来，我们用 RDM 矩阵对图像之间的相似性进行度量。典型情况下，RDM 矩阵是对称方阵，它的每个元素$(i, j)$代表对应索引的内容$(C_i, C_j)$之间的距离，距离越大代表两个内容越不相似，反之距离越小代表两个内容越相似

$$
RDM_{ij} = Distance(C_i - C_j)
$$

如下图所示，它的左侧是在被试观看 78images 图像时，对较高级视觉皮层（用 late 代表）进行 MEG 扫描，通过得到的神经活动数据进行计算，而得到的 RDM 矩阵，其中颜色越偏蓝代表距离越小，从而表示两图越相似。可以看到在右下角存在较明显的蓝色区域，与周围明显不同，这代表这些图像具有“排他”的相似性，它们是人的面部图像。

![Untitled](RDM%E4%B8%8E%E5%9B%BE%E5%83%8F%E5%85%B3%E7%B3%BB%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90%203f7284ebf63e4874978dcb6168261ae4/Untitled%203.png)

使用另外 92images 图像集发现了同样的情况。而更有意思的是，由于这个图像集中有一张猴子的面部图像，因此猴子图像所在的列呈现出一条明显的蓝线，这进一步验证之前的假设，即神经活动相似性能够反映在其计算的 RDM 矩阵中。

# 附录：Understanding Relative Dissimilar Matrix

## Introduction

Relative dissimilarity is a statistical measure used to compare the similarity or dissimilarity of two different sets of data. This measure is often used to compare the distance between two points in a data set, or to compare two sets of data. In this blog post, we will discuss how to understand relative dissimilar matrix, what it means and how it can be used.

## What is Relative Dissimilar Matrix

A relative dissimilar matrix (RDM) is a matrix that describes the relative dissimilarity between points in a data set. It is based on the distance between each point in the set, and is used to compare the similarity or dissimilarity between sets of data. As an example, a RDM can be used to compare the distance between two cities, or the distance between two points on a graph.

## How to Calculate Relative Dissimilar Matrix

The relative dissimilar matrix is calculated by taking the absolute differences between each point in the data set, and then normalizing the differences. This means that the values are scaled between 0 and 1, where 0 is the most similar point and 1 is the least similar. The RDM is then calculated by taking the square root of the differences and adding them together.

## Uses of Relative Dissimilar Matrix

The relative dissimilar matrix can be used to compare the similarity or dissimilarity of sets of data. This can be useful for determining the degree of similarity between two points in a data set, or for comparing two sets of data. It can also be used to identify clusters of data points that are more or less similar.

## Conclusion

In summary, relative dissimilar matrix is a statistical measure used to compare the similarity or dissimilarity of two different sets of data. It is based on the distance between each point in the set, and is used to compare the similarity or dissimilarity between sets of data. It can be used to compare the similarity or dissimilarity of sets of data, to identify clusters of data points, and to compare two points in a data set.

# Understanding Representational Dissimilarity Matrix

## Introduction

Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM) is a powerful tool for understanding the relationships between different concepts in a dataset. This blog post will discuss the basics of RDM, how it is used in research, and the advantages and limitations of using it.

## What is Representational Dissimilarity Matrix?

Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM) is a matrix that measures the similarity of objects in a dataset based on the features that represent them. It is an important tool for understanding the relationships between different concepts in the dataset. The RDM is a measure of the dissimilarity between two objects, based on their features. It is typically used to analyze how different objects are related to each other, such as a collection of images.

RDMs can be used to measure the similarity between two objects, by comparing the features of each object. For example, if two images have similar colors and shapes, they would have a low RDM score, indicating that they are more similar to each other than images with different colors and shapes.

## How is Representational Dissimilarity Matrix Used?

RDMs are commonly used in research to analyze relationships between objects and identify patterns in data. For example, RDMs can be used to compare the similarity between different images in a dataset, or to analyze the relationships between different words in a language.

RDMs can also be used to measure the similarity between different pieces of text or artwork. By comparing the features of the text or artwork, researchers can identify patterns and relationships between different objects.

## Advantages and Limitations of Representational Dissimilarity Matrix

The main advantage of using RDMs is that they provide a simple and effective way to measure similarity between different objects. They are also relatively easy to use, as they require minimal data processing.

However, RDMs have some limitations. For example, they only measure the similarity between objects based on their features, so they may not accurately represent the relationships between objects that have more complex relationships. Additionally, RDMs can become unreliable when the dataset is too large or complex.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM) is a powerful tool for understanding the relationships between different concepts in a dataset. It is a simple and effective way to measure the similarity between objects, but has some limitations. RDMs are commonly used in research to identify patterns and relationships between different objects, and can be used to measure the similarity between different pieces of text or artwork.
