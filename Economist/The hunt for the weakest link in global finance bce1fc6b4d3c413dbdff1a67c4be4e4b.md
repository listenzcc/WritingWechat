# The hunt for the weakest link in global finance

Credit Suisse won’t be the last firm to fall under the spotlight

Credit Suisse 不会是浮在台面上的最后一个倒霉蛋。

As interest rates rise and asset prices slump, investors are scrambling to identify the weakest links in the global financial system. Every bear market produces national and corporate victims who get skewered. In the 1997-98 rout Thailand’s economy imploded, as did ltcm, a hedge fund. Iceland and Lehman Brothers were victims in the 2008-09 slump.

随着利息上涨和资产价格跳水，投资者开始蜂拥寻找那些与全球金融市场联系最薄弱的环节。每个牛市都得抓到某个倒霉的国家或公司当作受害者用来献祭。想想 97-98 年亚洲金融危机的被对冲基金整惨的泰国。再想想 08-09 年金融危机的冰岛和 Lehman Brothers。（是不是有那么点感觉了？）

Today one country has already been picked-off: Britain, where the currency has fallen and the central bank has had to intervene in the bond market to bail-out the pension system, whose overseers had foolishly made vast bets on continued low volatility. Now some believe an institutional victim of the great 2022 sell-off in markets has been spotted: Credit Suisse, a storied Swiss firm that spans wealth-and-asset management, private banking and investment banking.

现今，一个国家已经被选中了，那就是英国，英镑在贬值，他们的央行为了保住养老金系统不得不出手干预股市，他们的领导人竟然愚蠢到宁可豪赌地相信未来的波动不会太大。（这一看就是英国人自己写的）现在许多人开始相信他们猜到了伟大的 2022 年的祭品，Credit Suisse，这是一家传奇的瑞士公司，它涉及了财富和资产管理、私人银行和投资银行领域。

Its shares have fallen by 55% this year and its credit-default swaps, which measure default risk, have risen. These two red lights will be familiar to anyone who witnessed Wall Street firms struggling in 2008-09, as will the statements by Credit Suisse’s managers that the bank has a strong liquidity and capital position. This year’s version of a confidence scare at a bank comes with a new twist, too: a swirl of malicious, mad and made-up rumours on Twitter and elsewhere. Welcome to the too-big-to-fail problem in the social-media age.

它的股票今年跌了 55%，它的 credit-default swaps （不太明白具体是什么玩意，不过应该是资不抵债的意思）飙升，眼看着就要债务违约了。这两条红线嘛，目睹 08-09 年华尔街经济危机时公司的困境的人都明白是什么意思，尤其是当 CS 的负责出来声称他们有“充足的流动性和资产”的时候。（当时雷曼兄弟也是这么说的）今年的信心崩塌肯定少不了新的戏法：在推特和类似网站上的恶毒、疯狂和编造的流言漩涡。那句话怎么说来着，欢迎来到社交媒体时代的“太大而不能倒”问题环节。

So does the claim on the message boards that Credit Suisse is “next” make sense? At a high level the idea that a big bank, shadow bank or investment firm might be in trouble is plausible. The financial system has become habituated to 15 years of rock-bottom interest rates. The hunt for yield has led insurers and other funds to stuff portfolios with long-duration assets that are ultra-sensitive to rising rates. American banks have retreated from lending as regulations have grown tighter, and instead a system of market-based credit has emerged that deals in trillions of dollars of low-quality debt. There have been some medium-sized blowups already, including of Archegos, a hedge fund, and Greensill, a lender.

那么，在大字报上的“CS”要玩儿完的消息真的有用吗？可以比较肯定地说，一家大银行、影子银行或投资公司可能处于麻烦当中的想法是有说服力的。要知道，经济系统已经习惯了持续 15 年的低利率运行。在这个逐鹿的时代，保险公司和其他投资机构的口袋里装满了长期资产，这些东西对于利率升高非常敏感。美国银行已经从贷款业务中撤出了，因为监管越来越严格，取而代之的是基于市场的信用系统，这个系统操作着万亿美元规模的低质债务。在那里已经存在着许多“中等体量”的泡沫，典型的有 Archeqos（对冲基金）和 Greensill（贷款公司）。

Furthermore, Credit Suisse has been poorly run and struggling for some time. It has suffered repeated risk-management and compliance scandals, including being exposed to losses from Archegos and Greensill. Its top management ranks have been a revolving door.

回到我们的 CS，这个管理混乱的，长期陷于麻烦的宝贝儿。它需要反复进行公关管理和回应丑闻，包括被曝光在与 Archegos 和 Greensill 的交易中大量亏损。它的管理层走马灯似的，简直就是旋转门。

Yet in most other respects it does not look like the epicentre of a financial explosion in the way that, say, Lehman, or aig, an insurer, were. Instead of rampant growth fuelled by hubris, Credit Suisse’s balance sheet has shrunk continuously over the past decade in dollar terms, as it has downsized itself into the second tier of global finance. Today it is the 54th biggest listed financial firm in the world by assets.

但是，当我们跳出来看，CS 又不像是金融爆炸的震中，它不像当年的 Lehman 或 aig 那样。CS的发家之路不是充满自信的野蛮疯长，它的资产负债表在近 10 年时间内持续缩减，并且它已经自觉地减小了自己的体量，落到全球金融的第二梯队。今天，按照资产数量来计算的话，它位列全球金融公司的第 54 位。

Its problems are idiosyncratic and, to a degree, an expression of management caution rather than recklessness. It owns a sub-par investment banking unit that needs to be shrunk or shut down. Based on the second-quarter results this division eats up 30% of its risk-adjusted assets and has annualised costs of chf8bn ($8bn). It is largely to blame for the firm’s overall quarterly pre-tax loss of chf1.17bn and awful return on equity of minus 14%.

它的问题其实比较特殊，从某种意义上讲，它属于管理谨慎的而非无所顾及的。它拥有一个 sub-par 投行单位，这个单位需要减小规模或关闭。（这个 sub-par 是啥意思，我没看懂）根据第二季度的财报，这个部门占有了 30% 的需要进行风险调整的资产，年度运行成本约 80 亿美元。公司全季度的税前亏损为 117 亿美元，它占去一大部分，而它只产生了约 14% 的利润。

Bitter experience from firms such as Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland teaches that shrinking an investment bank is a bit like decommissioning a nuclear reactor: dangerous and expensive. Star bankers leave and business dries up faster than you can cut costs and quit long-term contracts, leading to losses. Investors’ main concern has been that these potential losses might be so big that Credit Suisse would have to raise equity to ensure it had enough capital to support its ongoing businesses, which are fairly healthy.

缩减投资银行是有先例的，像 Deutsche  和 Royal Bank of Scotland 银行那样，缩减就像是关闭一座核电站：不仅危险，还很花钱。你缩减开支和退出长期合同的速度永远赶不上资深银行家离职的速度和业务干涸的速度，这些一定会导致亏损。投资人的主要担忧是这些潜在的亏损过于巨大，导致 CS 不得不依靠募集股权用来保证自己有充足的资金应付这些操作，而这个行为是健康的。（投资人心想：是，你是好了，我的股权也稀释了，那些个王八蛋捡了便宜）

Worries about financial firms can be self-fulfilling, as counterparties charge a higher risk-premium to lend to or deal with the firm, making it uncompetitive. In order to bring down its borrowing costs Credit Suisse will have to convince investors that it has a better proposal for shrinking its investment bank without incurring massive upfront losses. It plans to announce this on October 27th.

针对金融公司的担忧是很会自己吓自己的，竞争对手也会趁机提高与你合作的保费，你显得就没什么竞争力了。为了降低融资成本，CS 必须想办法说明投资者相信，他们有办法缩减自己的投资银行，并且这个过程不会导致无上限的损失。他们计划于今年 10 月 27 日公开这些计划。

But so far, at least, Credit Suisse is not an example of a business model which, in its spectacular excesses and implosion, encapsulates a broader madness in the markets. Instead it is an example of a relatively weak firm coming under pressure as financial conditions tighten and the economy flags. There will be many more of these, in many other industries. Meanwhile the hunt in the markets for “the big one” will go on. ■

但是，至少截至目前为止，CS 还不是一个能 in its spectacular excesses and implosion, encapsulates a broader madness in the markets（没懂什么意思，可能是说这种解燃眉于倒悬的事，他也没干过）。相反的，这倒是这样一个例子，一家相对弱小的公司如何在经济和金融紧缩的情况下处理压力。之后这种事情还会有很多，可能是发生在别的工业领域。同时，针对市场中的“庞然大物”们，这种事情还会继续。
