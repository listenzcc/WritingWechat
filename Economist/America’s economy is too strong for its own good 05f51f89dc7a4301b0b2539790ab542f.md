# America’s economy is too strong for its own good

Despite market turmoil, the Fed is set on relentless rate rises

尽管市场动荡，联邦仍然一意孤行地加息。

---

Two days after the latest interest-rate rise, the seven governors of the Federal Reserve met with some businessfolk. Any misgivings about the effects of tighter monetary policy would have been quickly dispelled. Cara Walton of Harbour Results, a consultancy, spoke of a plastics processor who hired 14 new employees, only for a mere three to show up on their first day (and one of those to quit before lunch). Cheetie Kumar, a restaurateur, said her peers were struggling to make rent as food and labour bills mounted. Tom Henning of Cash-Wa, a distribution company, explained his firm was passing costs onto customers. Demand was holding up, he said, thanks to the amount of money “floating out there in the economy”.

在上一次加息的仅仅两天后，美联储的 7 名官员会见了一些商界大佬。空气中瞬间弥漫着对收紧货币政策的不安的紧张气氛。来自 Harbour Results （咨询公司） 的 CW 新雇佣了 14 名员工，在首日仅有 3 名露面，其中 1 名在午餐中退出。经营餐馆的 CK 说她职位的前任受困于堆积如山的食物和工资账单。来自 Cash-Wa （物流公司） 的 TH 说他的公司将成本转移到消费者身上。他说，需求停滞了，这是由于“钱在经济中漂着”。（我不明白这个话是什么意思，也许看到后面会理解）

Misgivings may, however, have crept back in as the governors watched the markets over the past fortnight. The central bank’s goal is to tame inflation, which is running at more than 8% year on year, just shy of a four-decade high. The realisation that the central bank is still far from that goal, and that monetary tightening will thus continue, is causing havoc. American stocks have fallen for three consecutive quarters, and sharply recently. Bond prices are tumbling, reflecting tremors in the credit markets. The ratcheting up of rates in America is driving the dollar’s appreciation, adding to inflationary pressure elsewhere and impelling other central banks to follow the Fed’s lead, no matter the state of their economies. On September 30th Lael Brainard, the Fed’s vice chair, called for her fellow governors to proceed “deliberately”, a word denoting caution in the central bank’s argot. She also said the Fed would take its international impact into account.

这种恐慌也在一夜之间蔓延回到了监督市场的政府部门。央行的目标是“驯服（tame）”通胀，这个指标年复一年地高于 8% （的危险水平），处于近四十年的高位。央行目前离控制通胀的目标还很遥远，因此紧缩的货币政策仍将继续，而大家对这个态势的认知导致了严重的破坏（havoc）。美股连续三个季度下跌，最后跌得尤其快。债券价格下跌，反映了信用市场的恐慌。抬升（ratcheting）的利率导致美元走强，再加上无处不在的通胀压力，导致各国央行都要跟随美联储的政策，而罔顾本国的经济情况。今年 9 月 30 日，美联储副主席 LB 命令她的幕僚们实行“去自由化（deliberately）” ，所谓去自由化其实是央行界的黑话，意思是“小心点儿”。她还说，联邦将同时考虑政策的国际影响。

This was an acknowledgement of the risks of the current approach—it was not an indication that the central bank is about to change tack. The Fed simply cannot ignore the strength of the domestic economy. Even with the financial upheaval, America’s economy is straining at its limits in critical dimensions. In the labour market there are two jobs available for every unemployed person. Wages, up roughly 7% compared with a year earlier, are rising at their fastest pace since the early 1980s, according to the Atlanta Fed. Although house prices declined month on month in August, new home sales jumped, confounding expectations. Corporate profits are at their highest in decades as a share of gdp. Despite higher rates, consumer confidence has been climbing.

这仅仅是对当前的危机表示尊重，并不是说央行会因此改变目前的方针（tack）。美联储仅仅是无法忽视强劲的国内经济。在金融动荡的条件下，美国经济还是在逼近临界区域。（这啥意思，没看懂）在劳动力市场上，每位失业者都有两份工作机会可供选择。根据 Atlanta Fed 的调查，与上年同期相比，工资上涨了 7% ，达到了自 20 世纪 80 年代以来的最高上涨速度。自 8 月以来，尽管每个朋房价都有所下跌，新房销售仍然跳水，远低于预期。公司利润占 GDP 的比重处于近 10 年来的最高点。虽然利率更高了，但消费者信心却上升了。

This constitutes a serious challenge for the Fed: the more resilient the economy, the harder it will have to push to rein in inflation. More jumbo rate rises are thus on the cards, heightening the risk of a monetary mistake and an eventual recession. There is always a lag between shifts in monetary policy and their impact on real activity—the recent rate rises will inevitably take a toll on the American economy over the coming year. To get a sense of why, despite the brewing trouble, the Fed remains hawkish, it is crucial to understand why the economy has remained insulated so far.

这些情况给美联储出了难题：经济越容易恢复，通胀就越不容易控制（rein）。更大的加息就越可能实施，同时推高了货币政策失败的风险，最终导致衰退。这是一个永恒的难题，如何平衡货币政策与它对实体经济的影响，最近的加息政策必然极大地影响美国未来几年的经济。要搞清楚美联储仍然如此激进的背后的原因，除了它正在酝酿的（可以预见的）麻烦之外，还应该弄明白为什么说经济还仍然是被绝缘的。（这个怎么理解？）

The most obvious factor also explains America’s inflation: the government was more aggressive than others in stimulating the economy during the covid-19 pandemic. America’s primary budget deficit—the difference between government spending and revenues, excluding interest payments—averaged 10.5% in 2020 and 2021, more than triple its pre-pandemic level and higher than all other big rich countries.

美国现阶段通胀的最明显的原因是，政府比别国政府在新冠疫情期间更加激进地刺激经济。在 2020 和 2021 两年间，美国政府债务赤字，政府支出与收入的差值，再除去支付利息，平均是 10.5%，是在疫情前的三倍，并且比其他发达国家都要更多。

Formally, this stimulus ended some time ago. The last big short-term fiscal package was President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan (arp) in March last year. But in reality, stimulus is still working its way through the system. Hefty dollops of arp cash are only just hitting the economy. States were granted about $200bn in direct emergency funding. In August, they had yet to draw on a fifth of that. And they are still doling out the funding they have claimed. In the past couple of weeks alone, Louisville, Kentucky announced it would spend arp funds on affordable housing; Monroe Country, New York directed some to health services; and Cumberland Country, Tennessee splashed out on water and sewer projects.

从形式上讲，这些刺激在前段时间已经结束了。上一个大型短期经济包是 Joe Biden 总统于去年 3 月，在美国纾困计划（American Rescue Plan，ARP）中签署的。但事实上，这些刺激目前还在通过系统进行工作。直接掐断 ARP 的现金只会对经济造成损害。联邦募集了 2000 亿美元进行直接紧急投资。截至今年 8 月，他们花费了其中的五分之一。目前，他们仍然在继续进行投资。在过去的 2 周时间里，肯塔基州声称这些资金将用于保障住房（affordable housing）；纽约州计划用于健康服务；田纳西州用于水和灌溉项目。

Even more important is how the stimulus continues to puff up the balance sheets of both people and firms. Households sit on about $2trn in excess savings (relative to their pre-pandemic norm). They are now beginning to eat into this buffer—savings rates are well down this year. But the reserves have enabled them to spend at a decent clip even as inflation has eroded their incomes. It has been a similar story for businesses. At the start of the third quarter, they had about $2.8trn of cash in hand, down from the start of the year but about a quarter more than before the pandemic. They have also taken advantage of robust demand to pass on inflated input costs to customers, protecting their margins and then some. Post-tax corporate profits reached 12% of gdp in the second quarter, the highest since at least the 1940s. So long as companies are making profits, they look to hire, not fire, workers.

更重要的是，这些刺激推高了民众和公司的资产负债表。与疫情前相比，家庭储蓄中有 2 万亿美元的超额储蓄。他们开始使用这些储蓄，由于今年的利息下降了。尽管在通胀侵蚀他们的收入（的购买力）的情况下，这些存款也使他们的消费不下降太多。对于商业的影响与过日子类似。在第三季度开始时，他们拥有 2.8 万亿现金，虽然低于上一季度，但高于疫情前的水平。而且，由于具有稳健的需求作为支撑，商人能够将通胀的成本转移到消费者身上，从而保持自己的利润不变。在第二季度，公司的税后利润达到了 GDP 的 12%，达到了自 20 世纪 40 年代以来的最高值。只要公司还在盈利，他们就会招人，而不是裁员。

Nor has growth been hindered, as it has in Europe, by soaring energy costs following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Indeed, America has, in one sense, benefited from it. Exports of both crude oil and petroleum products are at an all-time high. In net terms America has exported about 1m barrels a day of crude and petroleum products since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—all the more remarkable given that America was a net importer to the tune of 10m barrels a day at the start of the century. The boom in oil-export earnings has contributed to a narrowing of America’s trade deficit, which may flatter its growth figures over the rest of this year.

美国的增长也还未停止，这一点与欧洲不同，因为那地方受到俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的影响能源价格上涨。事实上，从某种意义上讲，美国还从中受益。原油和化工产品的出口前所未有的高。入侵以来，美国原油和化工产品的净出口量为每天 1 百万桶，要知道在本世纪初，美国每天净进口 1 千万桶。由于石油出口的收入暴增，这无疑弥补了美国的贸易赤字，让美国年度增长数据变得更加好看。

American consumers have been rather less enthusiastic about higher prices at the pump. If they compared themselves with their peers in Europe, they might be more sanguine. Natural-gas prices have historically been a smidgen higher in Europe than America. These days they are about five times higher. Europe has been gradually cut off from Russia, its main gas supplier; America is awash with its own energy. It has only limited liquefaction capacity, which is needed for exports, meaning the gas it releases from the ground is mostly consumed domestically. In Europe monetary tightening is compounded by the negative shock from soaring energy prices, which is why forecasters expect a deeper recession. In America the Fed can more or less look beyond the ructions in the energy markets.

美国消费者对价格上涨并不怎么感冒。与他们的欧洲哥们相比，他们甚至可能乐开了花。天然气价格在历史上一般是欧洲稍高于美国。但这段时间欧洲的价格是美国的 5 倍。欧洲逐步掐断了来自俄罗斯的联系，要知道俄罗斯是欧洲天然气的主要供应商；而美国是能源充足的（awash）。美国只有有限的液化天然气的能力，液化是用于出口的，这代表美国领土上出产的天然气绝大部分用于国内消费。欧洲收紧货币政策的原因是出于能源价格上涨，因此政策预期是陷入更深的衰退。而美联储则可以或多或少地忽略能源市场的骚动。

Sooner or later, continued rate rises will drag on the American economy. That, after all, is the Fed’s intention. The most rate-sensitive sectors are already being hit. Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have reached 7%, the highest in more than a decade. A steep rise in credit-card balances suggests that households are starting to exhaust their savings. Higher interest rates will only make debts more onerous. Corporate profits also look set to flag—one reason for the recent stock-market plunge.

终有一天，不断上涨的利息会拖慢美国经济。美联储很关注这一点。对于利率最敏感的部门已经受到了冲击。30年期的抵押债券利率已经达到了 7%，处于近 10 年来的最高值。信用卡账单的激增已经说明业主位正在耗尽自己的积蓄。更高的利率会让债务显然更加棘手。公司利润也开始有受影响的迹象，因为最近股市开始暴跌。

Nevertheless, a slow, steady return to normality after covid acts as a buffer against these dangers. Take the property market. The inventory of homes available for sale remains very low by historical standards, in part because the supply of building materials, just like other goods, has been badly constrained over the past few years. A leap in mortgage rates would usually be expected to lead to a precipitous slowdown in construction activity. This time, though, builders are still building, trying to work through the backlog of unfinished homes.

总之，从疫情中恢复将是一个漫长和稳定的过程，在过程中要对抗这些风险。拿房地产市场为例。待售房源牌历史经验值的低位，部分原因是建筑材料供应出现了问题，这个和其他产品的情况类似，是受到前几年疫情的影响。而债券收益率上涨则会导致建设活动明显下降。但是在现在，建筑商们还在抓紧时间赶工来赶上落后的进度。

Meanwhile, goods consumption shot up during the pandemic as people bought new couches, bigger televisions and fancier exercise bikes for their homes. Now they are returning to cruises and concerts. This shift matters for the job market because services tend to be more labour-intensive. Even if consumers spend less in aggregate, they are spending more on the kinds of things that require lots of workers, boosting employment.

同时，在疫情期间商品消费提升，因为大家要添置新的家具和家电。现在他们要回归旅游和音乐会了。这使得服务业变得更加需要人手。假如消费者降低总体的消费量，他们还是会把钱花在更需要人服务的服务上，这会促进就业。

Spread over the entire economy, this is a powerful trend. America’s workforce today is basically the same size as in 2019. Its composition is, however, very different. There are 1m more workers in transportation and warehousing, reflecting the rise and rise of online shopping. At the other end of the spectrum, more than 1m workers have left the leisure and hospitality sectors over the past three years. According to the National Restaurant Association, a lobby group, roughly two in three restaurants are understaffed. Thus the slowdown in growth may lead to a smaller rise in unemployment than it otherwise would have done. Companies suffering from worker shortages have little fat to trim.

在整个经济中，这是个很强的趋势。美国当今的劳动力数量与 2019 年持平。但劳动力构成却迥然不同。比如，从事物流和仓储的工人增加了 1 百万人，说明线上消费的增加。在光谱的另一端，过去三年间，有 1 百万人离开了康复和医疗部门。根据国家旅馆协会的统计，有三分之二的旅馆处于人手不同的状态。因此，增长放缓会导致失业率的小幅上涨，但仍小于增长加速。那些缺人手的公司只需要小小地减一下肥。

So good, it’s bad

塞翁失马？

In one sense, this resilience is to be welcomed. It implies that a recession, if one arrives, is likely to be mild. But the Fed is determined to get inflation down, and is focused on wage growth as a proxy for underlying price pressures. Continued labour-market tightness therefore inclines the central bank towards a tougher, longer bout of monetary tightening.

从某个角度来说，恢复是可以预见的。它暗示着即使衰退来到，它也会是轻微的。但美联储却决心压制通胀，还固执地认为高工资会导致物价压力。持续性地用工短缺促使银行们实行一个更加严格和更加长期的货币紧缩政策。

The Fed has already raised rates by a full three percentage points this year, its steepest increase in four decades. As turmoil sweeps through financial markets, some economists have criticised the central bank for going too far, too fast. Some Fed officials also seem to be getting cold feet. But their hawkish colleagues have the upper hand after a year of upside surprises in inflation. The baseline expectation of investors is that the Fed will deliver at least another percentage point of rate increases before the end of the year. That may well be a conservative guess. Even after half a year of monetary tightening and a slowdown in growth, the economy still suffers from a shortfall of supply and a surfeit of demand—most especially for workers. In the face of such a mismatch, the only direction for interest rates is up. ■

美联储已于今年对利率上调了 3%，是四十年以来的最高上调。针对在金融市场蔓延的不安情绪，经济学家开始批评央行的政策过强、过快。一些联邦官员开始退缩。但他们的鹰派同事位则正为了近一年来的令人惊讶的高通胀忙得不可开交（have the upper hand）。业界对他们的预期是在年底前再进行约 1% 的加息。这也是比较保守的估计。尽管经历了半年的货币紧缩政策和经济下行，经济上还是面临供给不足和需求过度的问题，尤其是工人。而对于这个错配的问题，利率的唯一方向还是上涨。
