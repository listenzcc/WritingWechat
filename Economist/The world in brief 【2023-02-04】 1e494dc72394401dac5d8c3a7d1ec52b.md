## 【美国、中国】【外交】新年新气球

**Antony Blinken**, America’s secretary of state, [postponed his planned trip to China](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/03/how-a-balloon-burst-sino-american-talks) after the Pentagon detected a Chinese spy balloon flying over Montana. Mr Blinken was due to land in China on Sunday, and was expected to meet with President Xi Jinping. China denied that the object was a spy balloon, claiming it was used for “meteorological” purposes and had been blown off course.

美国国务卿布林肯（Antony Blinken）在五角大楼发现一个中国气球飞过蒙大拿州后，推迟了原定的中国之行。 中国否认该物体是间谍气球，称其用于“气象”目的，已被吹离航线。

## 【美国】【经济】美国雇主增加了51.7万个工作岗位

**American employers** added 517,000 jobs in January, an unexpectedly large increase in an already-tight [labour market](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/24/why-american-unemployment-needs-to-rise) and a sign that a recession is not quite close at hand. The unemployment rate fell by 0.1 percentage points to 3.4%, a 53-year low. To policymakers’ relief, wage growth slowed, with average hourly earnings rising by 0.3% from December. Stockmarkets dipped on the news, as investors expect the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates.

1月份，美国雇主增加了51.7万个工作岗位，这是本已紧张的劳动力市场意外的大幅增长，也是经济衰退尚未到来的迹象。失业率下降了0.1个百分点，至3.4%，创下53年来的新低。令决策者松了一口气的是，工资增长放缓，平均每小时收入比去年12月增长了0.3%。股市受此消息影响下跌，投资者预计美联储将继续加息。

## 【欧盟】【能源】欧盟同意对俄罗斯成品油设置价格上限

The **EU** agreed to a cap of $100 per barrel for exports of **Russia’s refined-oil products**, such as diesel, to take effect on Sunday. Fuel oil and other low-value exports will be capped at $45. A cap of $60 [already applies to Russian crude](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/01/why-the-wests-oil-sanctions-on-russia-are-proving-to-be-underwhelming). Insurers and shippers are prohibited from dealing in items covered by the cap unless they were bought below or at the designated price.

欧盟同意对俄罗斯成品油（如柴油）的出口实行每桶100美元的上限，该上限将于周日生效。燃油和其他低价值出口将被限制在45美元。60美元的上限已经适用于俄罗斯原油。除非保险公司和托运人以低于指定价格或以指定价格购买，否则禁止他们交易上限所涵盖的物品。

## 【俄罗斯、乌克兰】【战争】巴赫穆特激烈争夺

As Russia’s forces close in on the battered city of **Bakhmut**, Ukraine’s president said his troops would hold firm. Standing alongside EU leaders in Kyiv on Friday, Volodymr Zelensky declared that “no one will give away Bakhmut.” Meanwhile, America announced a new $2.2bn [aid package](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/01/25/nato-members-are-right-to-send-tanks-to-ukraine) that includes longer-range precision missiles.

随着俄罗斯军队逼近饱受打击的城市巴赫穆特，乌克兰总统表示，他的部队将坚守阵地。周五，泽连斯基在基辅与欧盟领导人站在一起，宣布“没有人会放弃巴赫穆特”。与此同时，美国宣布了一项22亿美元的新援助计划，其中包括远程精确导弹。

## 【国际】【和平】教皇方济各抵达冲突频发的南苏丹

**Pope Francis** pleaded for peace in a speech to government officials in Juba, the capital of conflict-ridden **[South Sudan](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/07/10/south-sudans-second-decade-may-be-as-troubled-as-its-first)**, where he arrived on Friday. “I beg of you…‘No more of this!’” he said, quoting Jesus in the New Testament, to an audience that included the country’s president. Joining him in South Sudan are the leaders of the Anglican and Scottish Presbyterian churches.

教皇方济各星期五抵达冲突频发的南苏丹首都朱巴，在向政府官员发表讲话时恳求和平。“我恳求你……‘不要再这样了！’”他引用《新约》中的耶稣对包括国家总统在内的听众说。与他一起在南苏丹的还有英国圣公会和苏格兰长老会的领袖。

**Google** invested about $300m and took a 10% stake in Anthropic, an **artificial-intelligence** startup, the *Financial Times* reported on Friday. Big tech is arming itself for [competition in AI](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/30/the-race-of-the-ai-labs-heats-up): Microsoft recently announced a further $10bn investment in and partnership with OpenAI, which built ChatGPT, a chatbot. Anthropic was founded by former employees of OpenAI.

## 【美国】【科技】谷歌和微软的 AI 博弈

**Bobi**, from Portugal, claimed the title of the world’s oldest dog after reaching the venerable age of 30, according to Guinness World Records. [His breed](https://www.economist.com/interactive/christmas-specials/2022/12/20/what-makes-certain-dogs-popular-in-certain-countries), a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo, usually lives for around 12 to 14 years. Bobi’s long life was very nearly cut short; his owners intended to put him down as a puppy but he escaped.

据英国《金融时报》周五报道，谷歌投资约3亿美元，并持有人工智能初创公司Anthropic 10%的股份。大型科技公司正在为人工智能领域的竞争做好准备：微软最近宣布对OpenAI进行100亿美元的投资，并与OpenAI建立合作关系，OpenAI创建了聊天机器人ChatGPT。Anthropic由OpenAI的前员工创建。

## 【国际】【战争】欧盟希望缓和乌克兰局势

****Tempering Ukraine’s EU aspirations****
Ukraine’s desire to [join the EU](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/06/16/the-eu-should-declare-ukraine-a-candidate-for-membership) lies at the heart of its conflict with Russia—which invaded last year to stop the country’s turn to the West. On Friday in Kyiv the bloc’s leaders will hold a summit with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, and Charles Michel, president of the European Council, will trumpet the EU’s massive financial support to Ukraine and confirm that its candidacy is progressing. But they will also dampen hopes of how quickly it can join.
Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said this week that the country could become a member in two years. EU officials say that is wildly unrealistic. Integrating a huge, impoverished country will be a political challenge. And the bloc demands Ukraine first undertake reforms, including to combat corruption. On February 1st the country’s security services raided the home of a well-known oligarch—earning plaudits from Ms von der Leyen for taking the issue of graft seriously.

乌克兰加入欧盟的愿望是其与俄罗斯冲突的核心，俄罗斯去年入侵乌克兰，以阻止该国转向西方。周五，欧盟领导人将在基辅与乌克兰总统泽连斯基举行峰会。欧盟委员会主席乌尔苏拉·冯德莱恩（Ursula von der Leyen）和欧洲理事会主席查尔斯·米歇尔（Charles Michel）将大力宣扬欧盟对乌克兰的大规模财政支持，并确认其候选资格正在取得进展。但它们也会打消人们对它能多快加入的希望。

乌克兰总理丹尼斯·什梅哈尔本周表示，该国可能在两年内成为成员国。欧盟官员表示，这完全不现实。整合一个庞大而贫困的国家将是一项政治挑战。欧盟要求乌克兰首先进行改革，包括打击腐败。2月1日，国家安全部门突击搜查了一位知名寡头的家，这位寡头因严肃对待贪污问题而赢得了冯德莱恩女士的赞扬。

## 【国际】【科技】AI 的新风口

![image (12).jpg](The%20world%20in%20brief%20%E3%80%902023-02-04%E3%80%91%201e494dc72394401dac5d8c3a7d1ec52b/image_(12).jpg)

****Big tech eyes AI****
Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Meta have all now reported their most recent quarterly earnings. Apart from Meta, which saw its share price soar after posting better-than-expected results, the news was generally glum. Sales growth in key markets, such as cloud computing, is slowing as customers cut back on spending. In response, America’s tech giants are increasingly betting on [artificial intelligence](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/30/the-race-of-the-ai-labs-heats-up).
On Wednesday Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta, talked up investments in AI in its recommendation algorithm and its advertising network. Microsoft has, according to the *Wall Street Journal*, invested as much as $10bn in OpenAI, the startup behind [ChatGPT](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/12/08/how-good-is-chatgpt), a popular AI-powered tool that gives human-like responses to questions. The software giant is reportedly working on incorporating OpenAI’s technology into Bing, its search engine.
Alphabet, Google’s parent company, recently introduced a model that generates music from text. It is expected to respond to Microsoft with its own AI-powered chatbot. And [the vogue for AI](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/30/the-race-of-the-ai-labs-heats-up) is not restricted to Silicon Valley. Baidu, a Chinese search giant, will reportedly launch its own chatbot in March.

微软、Alphabet、亚马逊、苹果和Meta现在都公布了最新的季度收益。除了Meta在公布好于预期的业绩后股价飙升外，该消息普遍令人沮丧。随着客户削减支出，云计算等关键市场的销售增长正在放缓。作为回应，美国科技巨头越来越多地押注于人工智能。

周三，Meta的老板马克·扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg）谈到了在人工智能推荐算法和广告网络方面的投资。据《华尔街日报》报道，微软已向OpenAI投资了100亿美元，OpenAI是ChatGPT背后的初创公司，ChatGPT是一种受欢迎的人工智能工具，可以对问题做出类似人类的回答。据报道，这家软件巨头正致力于将OpenAI的技术融入其搜索引擎Bing。

谷歌的母公司Alphabet最近推出了一种从文本中生成音乐的模式。预计它将用自己的人工智能聊天机器人来回应微软。人工智能的流行并不局限于硅谷。据报道，中国搜索巨头百度将于3月推出自己的聊天机器人。

## 【美国】【经济】重塑美国经济

****Remaking America’s economy****
President Joe Biden has [a plan](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/02/joe-bidens-effort-to-remake-the-economy-is-ambitious-risky-and-selfish) to change America’s economy. Audaciously, he has decided that the way to cope with three problems which are too hard to tackle separately is to deal with them all at once.In the past two years Congress has passed three bills—on infrastructure, semiconductor chips and greenery—that will make $2trn available. The idea is that, with government action, America can reindustrialise itself, bolster national security and dramatically reduce its carbon emissions all at the same time.
Those goals will sometimes conflict. Protectionism will infuriate the allies that support American security, if they lose vital home industries to American subsidies. The subsidies will also create inefficiencies: if green products such as wind turbines become more expensive, then the green transition will become costlier, too. Instead money should go towards technologies that are not yet commercially viable, such as new types of nuclear reactor. Nevertheless, America’s plan to spend $2trn could help save the planet.

乔·拜登总统有一个改变美国经济的计划。他大胆地决定，解决三个难以单独解决的问题的方法是同时解决所有问题。在过去两年中，国会通过了三项关于基础设施、半导体芯片和绿色环保的法案，将提供2万亿美元。其理念是，通过政府的行动，美国可以重新工业化，加强国家安全，同时大幅减少碳排放。

这些目标有时会发生冲突。如果支持美国安全的盟友因美国补贴而失去重要的本土产业，保护主义将激怒他们。补贴还将造成效率低下：如果风力涡轮机等绿色产品变得更昂贵，那么绿色转型也将变得更昂贵。相反，资金应该用于商业上尚不可行的技术，例如新型核反应堆。尽管如此，美国花费2万亿美元的计划可能有助于拯救地球。

## 【国际】【地缘政治】东盟寻求共识

****ASEAN’s search for consensus****
Foreign ministers from the Association of South-East Asian Nations gather in Jakarta on Friday for their quarterly talkfest. Those watching the region will try to see how the ten-country bloc might be influenced by Indonesia, which recently assumed the chairmanship.A representative from Timor-Leste will attend, awaiting final approval of its membership application submitted back in 2011. But the military government of [Myanmar](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/01/31/myanmars-civil-war-has-moved-to-its-heartlands), in power since a violent coup two years ago, is banned from attending. (A “non-political” representative from Myanmar has been invited instead.)
ASEAN relies on consensus. Yet its menagerie of different models of government, from Communist one-party states, such as Vietnam, to vibrant democracies, including the Philippines, makes it hard for members to agree. The bloc has shown some courage in pushing back against Chinese bullying in the [South China Sea](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/01/chinas-put-upon-maritime-neighbours-are-pushing-back). But its feeble five-point peace plan for Myanmar is languishing, ignored by the generals (hence their exclusion). Indonesia will hope to revive progress.

东南亚国家联盟（Association of South East Asian Nations）的外交部长周五齐聚雅加达，参加他们的季度谈话会。观察该地区的人将试图了解十国集团可能会受到最近担任主席国的印度尼西亚的影响。东帝汶的一名代表将出席会议，等待2011年提交的加入申请的最终批准。但缅甸军政府自两年前发生暴力政变以来一直执政，被禁止出席。（取而代之的是一名来自缅甸的“非政治”代表。）

东盟依靠共识。然而，从越南等共产主义一党制国家到菲律宾等充满活力的民主国家，其各种不同的政府模式让成员们很难达成一致。该集团在反击中国在南海的霸凌行为方面表现出了一定的勇气。但其针对缅甸的脆弱的五点和平计划遭到了将军们的忽视（因此被排除在外）。印度尼西亚将希望恢复进展。

## 【国际】【艺术】当驴子是什么感觉？

****What’s it like to be a donkey?****
The latest film by Jerzy Skolimowski, a Polish writer-director, has an unusual main character: a donkey. This unconventional casting has gone down well with critics. “EO” secured an Oscar nomination for best international feature film.
The film tells the story of its titular long-eared protagonist, whose name, EO, is a phonetic spelling of its bray. EO travels from a circus in Poland to Italy, and is betrayed, neglected and mistreated by humans along the way. The director takes pains not to anthropomorphise his subject and the film reveals the world through EO’s eyes—at times literally, with the camera positioned at the creature’s sightline.
What prompted the octogenarian film-maker to work with such a proverbially obstinate beast? Mr Skolimowski was motivated, in part, by animal-welfare concerns. And his respect for animals deepened during filming, as he bonded with the donkeys in his cast. According to Mr Skolimowski, donkeys “are stubborn, but they’re not stupid.”

波兰作家兼导演杰日·斯科利莫夫斯基（Jerzy Skolimowski）的最新电影有一个不同寻常的主角：驴子。这种非传统的演员阵容受到了评论家的好评。《EO》获得奥斯卡最佳国际剧情片提名。

这部电影告诉了一个长耳主角的故事，他的名字EO是其叫声的拼音。埃欧从波兰的一个马戏团旅行到意大利，途中被人类背叛、忽视和虐待。导演尽力不将拍摄对象拟人化，影片有时通过EO的眼睛真实地展现了世界，镜头对准了动物的视线。

是什么促使这位耄耋之年的电影制作人与这种众所周知的顽固不化的野兽合作？斯科利莫夫斯基先生的部分动机是出于对动物福利的担忧。在拍摄过程中，他对动物的尊重加深了，因为他与演员阵容中的驴子建立了联系。根据斯科利莫夫斯基先生的说法，驴子“很固执，但并不愚蠢。”
