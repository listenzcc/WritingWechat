# 你还是挣得太多：Your pay is still going up too fast

央行是干什么用的？在2023年，它是抗通胀用的。从2022年以来，（发达国家）央行将通胀率从10.7%降低到了5.4%，但他们设定的目标是2%，行百里路半九十，最后一点最难降。2024年的最后一块拼图是降低劳动力报酬，因为之前它们太高了。

## 提出问题

从2022年以来，（发达国家）央行将通胀率从10.7%降低到了5.4%，但他们设定的目标是2%。说明他们进入了最后的攻坚阶段，这个过程想必非常困难。

## 解决问题的手段

在后疫情时期，资本寻求雇佣更多的劳动力，导致劳动力供给不足。这导致劳动力价格（wage）的年度增长率达到了5%。这部分成本会最终转嫁到消费端，（推高通胀）。

因此，（央行）可以通过加息控制通胀，背后的原理是在生产增长疲软的大前提下（Given weak productivity growth across the world），增加资金成本会降低劳动力需求，从而将劳动力价格增长控制在3%以下。

### 目前的情况，好的方面

（事实上），这个计划已经开始奏效了，劳动力需求仅比劳动力供给高0.4%（峰值曾达到1.6%）。

这种情况并没有影响（普通人的）失业率，实际参加的工作的人的总量是增加的，发达国家的失业率还控制在5%以下。

### 目前的情况，差的方面

但控制通胀的最终目标（2%）并没有达到。美国从5.5%降低到了4.5%，英国是6%，发达国家的均值是5%。

## 分析和总结

高工资导致超预期的通胀，通胀又推高工资，这种情况存在吗？它存在。西班牙工人经过“友好协商”（extra bargaining power）修改了劳动合同，获得了“根据通胀水平而增长的工资”，之前增长的幅度是（通胀的）16%，在2014-21年，这个幅度达到了45%。来自比利时的一项OECD研究担忧这种现象会导致通胀成为顽疾。

今天更加宽松的工资协议会导致明天的通胀。（更糟糕的是），这种（追求工资增长的）情绪正在发达国家蔓延。

## 讨论和展望

然而，对这些发展有一个更乐观的解释。就像在2021-22年，当劳动力需求上升后工资需要一段时间才能加速增长一样，今天它们可能需要一些时间才会减速。毕竟，公司和工人很少重新谈判工资，通常是每年一次，这意味着工人可能只会慢慢意识到他们的议价能力不如以前。高盛集团另一家银行发布的美国估计数据表明，劳动力需求下降可能需要一年左右的时间才会体现为工资增长的下降，这表明通货紧缩的最后阶段将会非常缓慢，但最终会过去。

翻译成人话就是，现在的工资增长趋势滞后于之前的劳动力供给短缺，根据经验，工资增长的趋势也将随着劳动需求的下降而降低。因此，（由于工资高企而导致的）通胀指标会慢慢回落到预期值。

Why the last part of the inflation fight may be the hardest


Central bankers are entering the final stretch of their quest to [defeat inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/21/2022-has-been-a-year-of-brutal-inflation). Rich-world prices are rising by 5.4% year on year, down from a peak of 10.7% in October 2022. Although it is impressive progress, the last part of the quest—getting inflation from 5.4% to central banks’ targets of around 2%—could be the hardest. That is because labour markets are [not co-operating](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/30/real-wages-have-risen-in-america-and-are-rebounding-in-europe).

Not long ago employers wanted to hire many more workers than they could find, resulting in an unprecedented surge in unfilled vacancies (see chart 1). In 2022-23 global Google searches related to “labour shortage” jumped to their highest ever level. With plenty of other options, workers asked their bosses for big pay rises. Year-on-year wage growth across the rich world doubled from its pre-covid rate to close to 5% (see chart 2), adding to companies’ costs and in turn encouraging them to raise the prices they charged consumers.


To get inflation under control, wage growth therefore had to come back down. Given [weak productivity growth](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/hopes-for-a-post-pandemic-productivity-surge-will-be-disappointed) across the world, a 2% inflation target is probably achievable only if nominal wages grow by 3% a year or less. Central bankers hoped that by raising interest rates they would cause demand for labour to fall—ideally bringing down wage inflation without wrecking people’s livelihoods.

The first part of the plan has worked. Demand for labour (ie, filled jobs plus unfilled vacancies) is now only 0.4% higher than the supply of workers in the rich world, down from a peak of 1.6%. Searches for “labour shortage” have fallen by a third. Almost everywhere you are now less likely to see “help wanted” signs.

Lower demand for labour has also caused surprisingly little damage to people’s employment prospects. We estimate that, in the past year, falling vacancies have accounted for the entire decline in labour demand across the rich world. Over the same period the number of people actually in work has grown. The unemployment rate across the rich world remains below 5%. Some countries are even beating records. In Italy the share of working-age people in a job recently hit an all-time high—the country has swapped *la dolce vita* for *la laboriosa vita.*

But despite falling labour demand, there is less evidence of the final part of the plan: lower wage inflation. Although American pay growth is down from more than 5.5% year on year to around 4.5%, that is probably still too high for the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target. And elsewhere there is little evidence of progress. In recent quarters wage growth across the rich world has hovered at around 5% year on year. British wage growth is more than 6%. “Very early indications for January show negotiated pay deals slowing only modestly,” reported analysts at JPMorgan Chase, a bank, last week. Euro-area pay is growing similarly fast.

Is high wage growth, and thus above-target inflation, now baked into the economic cake? Some evidence suggests it is—especially in Europe. Spanish workers, for instance, have used their extra bargaining power to change their contracts, such that the share of workers whose pay is indexed to the inflation rate has risen from 16% in 2014-21 to 45% last year. A recent study by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, on Belgium worries about “more persistent inflation due to wage indexation”.

More generous wage agreements today could lead to higher inflation tomorrow, leading in turn to even more generous wage agreements. Across the rich world strikes have become much more common, as workers seek higher wages. Last year America lost almost 17m working days to stoppages, more than in the previous ten years combined. Britain has also seen a [surge in industrial action](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/11/03/britain-faces-a-wave-of-industrial-action-this-winter). On January 30th Aslef, a union for train drivers, is expected to begin a series of walkouts.

There is, however, a more optimistic interpretation of these developments. Just as in 2021-22, when wages took a while to accelerate after labour demand rose, so today they could take time to lose speed. After all, companies and workers renegotiate wages infrequently—often annually—meaning that workers may only slowly realise that they have less bargaining power than before. Estimates for America published by Goldman Sachs, another bank, indicate that it can take a year or so for declines in labour demand to show up as lower wage growth—suggesting that the final stretch of disinflation will be annoyingly slow, but will pass. ■
