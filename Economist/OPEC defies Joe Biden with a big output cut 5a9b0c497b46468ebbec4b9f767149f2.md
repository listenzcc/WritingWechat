The organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (opec) is sometimes called the oil market’s central bank. Every month the cartel and its allies, some 23 countries that produce 40% of the world’s oil, meet to decide on production targets. The aim is to keep prices high and stable. But just as central-bank governors argue about the speed of rate rises, members of opec+, as the wider group is known, disagree on how fast to turn the spigots.

石油输出国组织（OPEC），又称石油央行。石油卡特尔（Cartel） 及其盟友们，它们的规模是 23 个国家生产的石油满足世界石油需要的 40%，每个月碰面一次，决定下个月的产量。这样做的目的是保持石油价格在高位保持稳定。就像央行官员会为了增长速度吵个不停一样，OPEC 扩大组织（OPEC+）的成员们对于 ”挤出多少油” 这个问题的答案并不统一。

The latest summit on October 5th was a short one—but the decision that emerged was controversial. Ending a series of online meetings and timid tweaks to output, opec+—which includes Russia—met in person for the first time since the covid-19 pandemic. Emerging from a Viennese boardroom, ministers confirmed that they would cut production by 2m barrels a day (b/d), an amount equivalent to 2% of the world’s total output. After months of market volatility and missed targets, the cartel is determined to restore its credibility and regain control of the oil price.

他们 10 月 5 日的会晤非常短暂，但是决定却非常劲爆（controversial）。它结束了自新冠疫情以来的线上会议，并且一改之前惜字如金的情况，OPEC+（包括俄罗斯）进行了线下会面。他们在威尼斯的发布会表示，部长们确认他们将原油日产量降低 2 百万桶，约占全球总产量的 2%。 在连续几个月的市场波动和偏离目标之后，卡特尔决定恢复自己的权威（credibility），并重新掌握石油价格。

Members are worried about falling demand. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has dropped to $93 a barrel, down from $125 in June. Pricey petrol has led to lower consumption. Europe’s gas crunch, China’s covid policies and property troubles, and rising interest rates augur a global recession. The strong dollar, in which oil prices are denominated, makes the fuel still less affordable outside America. opec+ does not explicitly say so, but its members want a floor under the price at a time when increased spending at home implies a higher breakeven price. Experts place that floor at between $80 and $100, compared with $70 to $80 before covid.

成员担忧需求会降低。（那这个降低是不是因此呢？从这句话看不出来）布伦特国际原油价格（Brent crude）已经从今年 7 月的 125 美元每桶跌到了 93 美元每桶。 同时汽油价格上涨导致了消费低迷。（汽油属于轻质原油，但我没弄明白这个石油价格下跌为啥没有带动汽油价格一块跌？是不是他也没说清楚？）欧洲缺气，中国在抗疫（同时还略微有那么一丁点儿的地产问题），利息还在上升，这些导致全球性的经济衰退。由于石油价格是以美元计的，因此强势的美元导致美国之外的地区的能源价格就有点棘手。虽然 OPEC+ 没有直说，但它的成员显然希望给石油价格设一个下限，这样国内财政至少可以收支相抵。专家预测这个底限价格差不多是在 80 到 100 美元之间，而在疫情之前，这个价格是 70 到 80 美元。

The cartel has rarely had such an opportunity to set prices. No country outside of its biggest members has the capacity to ramp up output fast, and global stocks are low. Crude inventories in the oecd, a club of mostly rich countries, remain well below their five-year average; China is running down its stockpiles in a bid to satiate its thirsty refiners. The volume of oil on water may be rising, but that is only thanks to the longer tanker journeys that are required as the market adjusts to sanctions, rather than growth in floating storage, notes Giovanni Serio of Vitol, a trader.

对卡特尔来说，这是一个设置价格的千载难逢的好机会。你看，除了它的主要成员之外，其他国家都没有能力大幅提高产量，同时全球库存也处于低迷。富国俱乐部（OECD，a club of mostly rich countries）国家的库存低于他们的 5 年平均值；中国在去库存以满足他们饥渴的从业者。（这啥意思？）来自交易公司 Vitol 的 Giovanni Serio 表示，水上漂着的石油（oil on water）体量可能上升（其实就是正在船上运输的油），但这是由于市场对于制裁的调整动作导致石油运输线回升，并不是说浮在水上的仓库储量增加。

The problem opec+ faces is that its credibility is in tatters. Even the cut announced on October 5th is not what it seems. Its members have failed to invest in production, leading to a gap between target and actual output (see chart). In reality the cut will only apply to members that are hitting or are near to their targets. Ehsan Khoman of mufg, a bank, expects the revision to deliver a real cut of up to 1.1m b/d.

而 OPEC+ 所面临的问题是自己信守承诺的名声不怎么好。尽管 10 月 5 日嘴上说着一套，但上去并不是那么回事。它的成员国并没有落实到产能部门，这导致目标与实际产出之间有差距。事实上，这个产能削减只会作用到正在达到或靠近目标的成员国。来自 MUFG 银行的 Ehsan Khoman 表示希望达到的产能缩减最乐观能够达到 110 万桶每天。（这 TM 和目标差了快一倍）

The tactic is nevertheless working—at least for now. The oil price has risen by 11% since September 26th, when rumours of the cartel’s plans first emerged. That makes the reduction worthwhile even for Saudi Arabia, which will trim its output by 5%, but ought to benefit from an increase in price twice the size. Jorge León, a former opec analyst now at Rystad Energy, a consultancy, reckons that Brent could surpass $100 by the end of the year. After the meeting, the Saudi energy minister said that, unless the market changes, the supply curbs will remain until the end of 2023.

但这个声称的手段至少目前是生效了。自 9 月 26 日以来，首次有卡特尔（减产）计划的传言时，石油价格就提高了 11%。这样这个减产对沙特阿拉伯来说就非常值了，因为它减产了 5%，但利润却翻了一翻。一名供职于咨询公司 Rystad Energy 的前 OPEC 分析师 Jorge Leon 表示，布伦特原油价格今年年底有望超过 100 美元。在此次会议之后，沙特能源部长表示，除非市场变化，否则供应职能制措施会持续到 2023 年底。

But the decision is not without risk. opec+’s market share is yet to recover from huge cuts it made in 2020 to shore up prices amid a collapse in demand. Trimming production again may further erode the cartel’s market share. The cut is also a snub to President Joe Biden, who recently visited Saudi Arabia in an attempt to cajole it into pumping more, before tough midterm elections next month. He responded to the decision by sniffing that the cuts were “unnecessary”, and announcing that America would release another 10m barrels from its strategic reserve next month. The decision also provides fuel to nopec, a congressional bill that would allow the cartel to be sued under antitrust law, although it will have to overcome opposition from lawmakers and oil firms who fear retribution.

但这个决定并非没有风险。OPEC+在 2020 年的减产导致其市场份额遭到重挫，当时是在需求崩溃的条件下寻求涨价。此次减产会进一步侵蚀卡特尔的市场份额。此次减产也是打了美国总统拜登的脸，他近期，就在下个月艰难的中期选举的前夕，才访问沙特阿拉伯，试图劝诱其增加石油产量。他对减产决定嗤之以鼻，说它“没有必要”，他还声明美国下个月将从自己的能源储备中释放 1000 万桶原油。（这啥意思，先顶 10 天？）他还决定对 NOPEC （一个国会提案）提供帮助（provides fuel），它允许对卡特尔提起反托拉斯诉讼，虽然这个玩意肯定会遭到立法者的反对，并且石油公司也怕会被报复。

opec+’s loss in market share should be partly reversed when it eventually cranks up output again. Thus it is the decision’s impact on demand, with higher prices likely to further reduce consumer appetite, that will probably do more damage to opec+’s position. Cutting output in a tight market also creates more volatility, not less—the extra uncertainty will discourage investors and lenders, reducing liquidity in the paper oil markets.

OPEC+损失的市场份额可以通过之后再把产能涨回来而得到弥补。因此，它的影响主要还是在需求端，高价格会在进一步降低消费意愿，这可能会对 OPEC+ 的地位造成更严重的损害。而在紧缩的市场进行减产也会导致更大的波动，而不会抑制波动，这是因为额外的不确定性会吓跑投资者的贷款商，最终导致纸石油市场流动性降低。

The decision may also reignite diplomatic tensions within the cartel. Since quotas no longer reflect actual output, the latest cuts are being shouldered by just a handful of members—Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the uae—that were already prevented from producing quite as much as they ideally would. The uae, which secured a small increase in July but plans to expand its production capacity from 4m b/d today to 5m b/d in 2025, will almost certainly agitate for a rejig in future negotiations. This will be resisted by underperformers such as Angola and Nigeria, says Robin Mills of Qamar Energy, another consultancy, in the hope that they can one day rebuild their capacity.

这个决定也会重新点燃卡特尔内部的外交矛盾。由于报表不再能够代表真实产能，最终的减产只会落到部分成员国身上，比如伊拉克、科威特、沙特阿拉伯和阿联酋，这些国家已经获得了防止他们偷偷增产的警惕，因为他们是有先例的。（是，还打过仗呢，那叫海湾战争）特别是这个阿联酋，他们曾经保证在 7 月只少量增产，但却偷偷准备好了提高产量，现在可以日产 4 百万桶，并且在 2025 年能达到日产 5 百万桶，他们在未来的谈判中肯定会闹着重新分配份额。来自咨询公司 Qamar Energy 的 Robin Mills 表示，这肯定会导致安哥拉和尼日利亚这些目前表现欠佳者的抵制，（老实人啊），他们肯定会想着有朝一日也能重建自己的产能。

Ironically, Russia could offer the cartel a solution. The country has long been a staunch advocate for higher production. But its output is now likely to fall, both soon, as a result of a European embargo set to start in December, and in the long run, as sanctions prevent it from getting access to vital partners, people and parts. Saudi Arabia and the uae are in bed with “a weakening business partner”, says Karen Young of Columbia University. Russia will be reluctant to give away some of its quota. The question is whether, in a world where it has ever fewer friends, doing so is a price worth paying to remain inside the tent. ■

具有讽刺意味的是，俄罗斯肯定会完成卡特尔的任务。这个国家就一直闹着要增产。但它的出口却很有可能下跌，出于两个原因，首先在当下，欧洲计划于 12 月对它实行禁运，另外在长期，制裁使得他无法与重要伙伴、个人或部分达成交易。沙特和阿联酋和“不断虚弱的伙伴”同在一条船上，这样说的是来自 Columbia University 的 Karen Young。俄罗斯也肯定不愿放弃自己的份额。现在的问题是一个是或否的选择，在这个朋友越来越少的世界上，花钱呆在这个帐篷里是还是值得的？
