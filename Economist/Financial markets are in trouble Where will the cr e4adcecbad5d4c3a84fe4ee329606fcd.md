# Financial markets are in trouble. Where will the cracks appear?

The first big test of a new-look financial system

经济新常态下的第一次大考

Oct 4th 2022 | NEW YORK

---

It is hard not to feel a sense of foreboding. As the Federal Reserve has tightened policy, asset prices have plunged. Stocks, as measured by the Wilshire 5000 all-cap index, have shed $12trn of market capitalisation since January. Another $7trn has been wiped off bonds, which have lost 14% of their value. Some $2trn of crypto market-cap has vanished over the past year. House prices adjust more slowly, but are falling. Mortgage rates have hit 7%, up from 3% last year. And this is all in America—one of the world’s strongest economies.

山雨欲来风满楼。美联储在加息，资产价格在跳楼。从今年 1 月以来，股票（以 Wilshire 5000 为例）套牢了 1 万 2 千亿美元的市场资本。另有 7 千亿美元以 14% 的损失为代价割肉离场。比特币市场更是直接在一年中蒸发了 2 千亿美元。住宅价格调整得比较慢，但始终在跌。按揭贷款利息从去年的 3% 上涨到了今年的 7%。这就是世界最大经济体，阿美利坎。

Rising rates will slow the American economy and should break the back of inflation. But what else will they break? Since the Federal Reserve raised rates again on September 22nd, global markets have been in turmoil. When the British government announced unfunded tax cuts a day later, fire-sales by pension funds caused the yield on government bonds (or “gilts”) to spiral out of control. Contagion then spread to the American Treasury market, which is as volatile and illiquid as it was at the start of covid-19. The cost to insure against the default of Credit Suisse, a global bank, has risen sharply. These ructions indicate the world is entering a new phase, in which financial markets no longer just reflect the pain of adjusting to the new economic context—pricing in higher rates and lower growth—but now also spread pain of their own.

利息上涨会拖慢美国经济，同时遏制通胀。但它还有哪些副作用呢？自 9 月 22 日美联储再次加息以来，世界市场陷入恐慌。在英国政府宣布对无准备金税减税（unfunded tax cuts）的一天之后，养老金的火速抛售导致政府债券螺旋式失控。它的传染效应迅速蔓延到美国国债市场，那场景和新冠疫情刚刚开始时是一模一样的。针对 Credit Suisse 跨国银行债务违约的不确定性所造成的成本急剧飙升。这些骚动说明世界经济正在迈入新的篇章，那里经济市场不再反映新型经济活动的调整型阵痛，一般伴随着高利息和低增长，（这些都是历史了），而在新时代里，经济市场本身向外散发着他自己的痛感。

The most catastrophic pain is felt when financial institutions fail. There are two ways they do so: illiquidity or insolvency. Tighter monetary policy is likely to prompt or reveal both. It is illiquidity that comes first—and it has well and truly arrived. Take the British pension funds. They use a strategy called “liability-driven investing” to hedge against interest-rate moves. When rates shot up they faced margin calls, which they met by selling gilts. But yields moved so fast that this became a fire-sale, with prices spiralling downwards. The Bank of England had to step in to buy bonds. No one else was willing.

当大型金融机构轰然倒下时带来的痛感是最具灾难性的一种。它体现在两个方面，去流动性（illiquidity）与资不抵债（insolvency）。紧缩的货币政策会诱发或促使这两种情况发生。通常，去流动性是最先到来的，现在它们已经来临了。拿英国养老基金为例。他们使用债务驱动（liability-driven investing）的投资方式（a牵头就是加杠杆），用来对抗利息上升带来的影响。当利息升高，他们就面临追加保证金（margin calls）的要求，于是他们就开始卖政府债。但是当收益率变动过快，以至于导致挤兑的情况下，价格就开始螺旋式下跌。英格兰银行不得不出手购买这些债券。因为别人根本不买。

Credit costs are rising quickly, as would be expected in these circumstances. Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley, a bank, highlights how abrupt the shift has been: “In the most recent senior-loan-officers survey every single question they asked bankers about financial conditions flipped to tightening, all at once. I have never seen that before.” Yet the real problem is when credit is unavailable—no matter the price. British traders report there were “no bids” for gilts in the days after the government announced its plans. Measures of liquidity in the Treasury market have deteriorated, too. “We are seeing what happened in March 2020 again. The same Treasury bonds are trading at different prices, bid-ask spreads are widening,” says Darrell Duffie of Stanford University. Strategists at Bank of America describe their index of credit stress as “borderline critical” .

在这些情况发生时，信用成本也会急剧增加。来自 Morgan Stanley 银行的 Betsy Graseck 为了说明变化来得有多么突然时，他表示“我从没有见过这种场面。就在最近，高级贷款经理们跟商量好了一样，见面第一句话就开始问你，紧缩后经济会怎么样？”而真正的问题来自信用不再可知，这跟价格还没什么关系。英国的交易员者们说，政府放出风来之后，这几天都没有买政府债的。在流动性方面，国债市场也一样完蛋。来自 Stanford University 的 Darrell Duffie 表示，”现在所见的和 2020 年 3 月时简直一模一样。同一种国债你能在市场上看到一堆价格，都在找人接盘。“来自 Bank of America 的政策官员称现在的信用压力已经达到了临界（borderline critical）。

Equity markets have been just as turbulent, but they have at least continued to function. “You might not have liked the price you were seeing,” says Tal Cohen of Nasdaq, a stock exchange, “but you were always seeing a price.” He has yet to witness “demand destruction”, the thinning out of the order book when buyers and sellers begin to pull their orders en masse. This is despite the fact that the Bank of America’s strategists think markets have fallen to levels at which accumulated losses may be forcing funds to sell assets to raise cash, accelerating the sell-off.

股权市场也是一样混乱，不过他们至少还在履行正常功能。来自 Nasdaq 交易所的 Tal Cohen 说，”你可能不满意拿到的价格，但是你至少能拿到一个价格“他曾经目睹过”需求崩溃“，那个时候根本没有交易，买卖双方还得凑一堆人把定单合起来弄。（这有点冲突），尽管 Band of American 政策官员的想法（不太一样），他认为市场已经堕落到了不断累积的亏损逼得基金公司卖掉全部资产，以换取现金，那样的话会加速卖出。

Regardless, illiquidity in credit markets is enough of a problem. It can morph into a total lack of lending. Last week British banks rushed to pull mortgages from their proverbial shelves. If this dynamic gets out of hand it can typically be solved by central banks stepping in and operating as a lender of last resort, as the Bank of England did. The risk of doing so is not trivial, however. Such an intervention employs quantitative easing, buying securities using central-bank money—the path used by central banks to ease monetary policy. Thus it might undermine faith in central bankers’ commitment to fighting inflation.

无论如何，信用市场的去流动性已经是足够严重的问题了。它（随时）可能演变成贷款短缺。上周，英国银行紧急地把抵押从架子上抽出来。（没明白这个谚语是啥意思）。如果这些流动性失控的话，它能够通过央行介入充当最后担保人（last resort）的方式得到解决，Bank of England 也正是这么做的。然而，这么做的风险嘛，不好说（not trivial）。这个行为相当于进行了量化宽松，就是用央行的钱买股票，这是央行进行货币宽松政策的通常做法。因此，它会削弱市场对央行对抗通胀的承诺的信心。

Market-watchers now wonder whether all this pressure will lead to insolvencies, which happen when the value of an institution’s assets falls below its liabilities. It is the fate which befell insurers, including aig, and banks, including Lehman Brothers, in 2008. Homeowners across America defaulted on their loans, meaning mortgage-backed securities, assets the firms had bought, were no longer worth anything close to that for which they had been purchased. Insolvency is fatal, and only resolvable by bankruptcy or bail-outs.

市场观察者现在最想知道的是这些压力是否会最终导致资不抵债，这种情况在一个机构的资产低于负责的时候就会发生。这种悲剧命运在 2008 年的保险公司、银行（雷曼兄弟）身上发生过。当时美国的业主们集体断供，这导致基于这些房屋抵押的一切保险、资产变得一文不值（与它卖出时的价格相比）。资不抵债是必然的，只能通过破产或政府纾困来解决。

No time for cramming

没时间敷衍了

The current tension is the first big test of a new-look financial system. Regulators have sought to make systemically important institutions—as Lehman Brothers surely would have been designated—too safe to fail. They have done this by compelling firms designated as such to follow stringent capital, liquidity and risk-taking rules, as well as by stress-testing them in hypothetical economic breakdowns. Regulators have also tried to reduce opacity and counterparty risk—the channels through which fears about Lehman morphed into suspicion of the entire banking system.

目前的紧张情况是经济新常态情况下的第一次大考。政策制定者们已经习惯于系统性的重要机构，就像雷曼兄弟银行那样的，巨大而不会倒的玩意儿。这些庞然大物是说服公司在设计过程中，遵循紧资本的，流动性的和承担风险的规则，并且对它们进行假想经济崩溃条件下的抗压测试。政策制定者还试图降低透明和竞争风险，这个做法形成一些通道，（通过这些通道）对雷曼兄弟的恐惧演变成了针对整个银行系统的怀疑。

The result is that there are layers of protection around the financial system’s most important institutions. At the heart of markets are clearing houses, which settle trades in stocks and derivatives between their members (mostly big banks). To join a clearing house a member must post an “initial margin” in case of default; that margin can climb if markets move. The system is stress-tested against the default of even the clearing houses’ largest members, such as JPMorgan Chase or Citigroup.

这样做的结果是在经济系统最重要的部门之外建立了保护层。在市场的核心是一片净土（clearing houses），这里安放着股票交易，以及它们的成员（几乎都是大银行）之间的衍生品交易。要加入他们，成员需要提供万一债务违约时的安全边界；并且边界在市场转移时应该是可以逾越的。这个系统针对债务违约进行压力测试的效果是能够承担它们当中规模最大的成员倒下，比如 JPMorgan Chase or Citygroup。

The banks, which stand between the clearing houses and other financial institutions, such as pension funds, hedge funds and insurance firms, are also in better shape than they were heading into the financial crisis. The issues that precipitated the failure of Lehman Brothers were that the firm did not have enough capital (at times leading up to its demise it held capital worth just 3% of assets), it had taken on too much borrowing (holding debt worth 30 times its equity), its business model was dubious (making enormous bets on the American housing market), and it had taken on vast amounts of risk.

银行就处于这片净土与其他金融机构之间，比如养老基金，对冲基金和保险公司，这些公司比它们处在金融危机中时的状态还要好一些。当时雷曼兄弟骤然倒下的原因是公司没有足够的资金（当时他持有的资金仅占其资产的 3%），再加上借了太多的债（债务规模是 30 倍市值），商业模式存疑（过分依赖美国房地产市场），总之一句话，他们承担了过于巨大的风险。

Today there are 30 global banks designated as systemically important by regulators, some 28 of which are included in the kbw Nasdaq Global Bank Index, which tracks bank stocks. These 28 banks hold 13% of their assets as capital, and have debt worth five times their equity. But they do not get an entirely clean bill of health: some business models look fragile. On average the banks returned 9% profit on their equity last quarter, but the worst (other than Credit Suisse) returned just 4%. It is hard to assess, from the outside, whether any have taken huge risks.

现在，有 30 家跨国银行被政策制定者指定为系统重要（systemically important），其中有 28 家在 Nasdaq Global Bank Index 中，是银行股的风向标。这 28 家银行的资金是其资产的 13%，债务规模是其市值的 5 倍。但他们并非完全没问题，有些银行的商业模式就很脆弱。在上季度中，银行平均拿到了 9% 的利润，但最差的（当然，不包括 Credit Suisse）只拿到了 4%。外界很难知道有哪家有潜在风险。

“American banks are unequivocally much stronger,” says a bank boss. Few are making such statements about European banks, and certainly nobody is about Credit Suisse. The firm had a return on equity of minus 14% last quarter, its share price has tumbled and its market capitalisation is now just $12bn. Yet even Credit Suisse is not near a Lehman-style collapse. It holds 14% of its assets as capital and has debt worth only six times its equity. Although Credit Suisse credit-default swaps, which act like insurance against default, have leapt, they still suggest the chance of default is in the low to mid-single digits.

一家银行的老板说，美国银行毫无疑问的强大。欧洲银行就没人敢这么说，尤其是 Credit Suisse。在上一季度，公司的市盈率降低了 14%，股份严重下挫，市场规模仅有 120 亿美元。但 Credit Suisse 与当时的雷曼模式的崩溃并不一样。它持有占全部资产 14% 的资金，并且它的债务仅是自身市值的 6 倍。虽然 CS 在信用违约的边缘疯狂试探，看上去不是资不抵债就是违约，（在这种情况下）分析还认为违约的概率还只是个位数。

Big banks therefore head into the new era fortified. But the regulation that has strengthened their defences has also diminished their role. High capital demands make it hard for them to compete. Because banks must add risk weights to all kinds of assets, they now hold only the boring stuff. Leverage ratios constrain their size, even in the gilt markets. By contrast, financial institutions that are not systemically important are unencumbered by these rules.

大银行还是进入了增强自身的新时代。但政策层面对它们防御的加强却不断示微。他们不再能够满足高企的资本需求。（没懂这个他们应该是指银行，还是监管，看后文应该是银行）因为银行需要为风险管理配置多种资产，而他们现在只持有无聊的玩意儿。杠杆率限制了他们的规模，这一点就连英国政府债也不例外。相反的，被排除在系统重要俱乐部之外的金融机构则不受这些条条框框的束缚。

The impact can be seen on balance sheets. In 2010, just after the financial crisis, banks held $115trn of financial assets. Other financial institutions, such as pension funds, insurers and alternative asset managers, held roughly the same amount. In the years since, the non-banks’ slice has grown. By the end of 2020 they held assets worth $227trn, a quarter more than the banks. Similarly, the share of American mortgages that came from banks was around 80% before the financial crisis. Today only around half of mortgages emerge from banks, and most of these are sold on to investors.

这些影响反映在资产负债表上。在经济危机刚刚结束的 2010 年，银行持有 11 万 5 千亿美元的金融资产。而其他金融机构，比如养老基金、保险公司和其他资产管理者，他们的账户体量是差不多的。而在近几年，非银行规模在增长。在 2020 年末，他们的资产市值为 22 万 7 千亿美元，比银行高四分之一。与之相似的是美国来自银行的抵押比例，在经济危机之前占 80%。而如今只有大约一半的紧急抵押（mortgages emerge）来自银行，其余的大部分则出投资者卖出。

The flight of risk

风险凌云

Thus the dodgy stuff is probably in other institutions. Which ones? In 2007 problems started in real estate. This time Americans hold far less mortgage debt, but the sheer pace of price growth in residential housing suggests some buyers will face difficulties. Indeed, three-quarters of those who bought in the past two years regret their decision. Other forms of real estate are also vulnerable. Firms are downsizing their offices to adapt to working from home, posing problems for highly leveraged commercial developers. Charles Bendit of Taconic Partners, a developer in New York, notes that lots have opted for floating-rate debt, meaning their debt-servicing costs have already doubled.

因此，风险可能出现在非银行的其他机构中。哪些呢？在 2007 年问题出现在房地产。那个时候美国人储蓄远小于抵押债务，但是居民住房价格却垂直上涨，这导致买家面临困境。事实上，过去两年间有四分三的购买者表示后悔他们的（购房）决定。而其他形式的房地产则呈现脆弱。公司缩小他们的办公室，并开始适应居家办公，用来迎合高杠杆的商业扩张。来自纽约开发公司 Taconic Partners 的 Charles Bendit 表示，许多人接受浮动利息的债务（九出十三归？），这表明他们的债务服务成本已然翻倍。

Michael Burry, who shot to fame in 2008 after shorting mortgage-backed securities, is concerned by unsecured consumer finance given the growth of “buy-now-pay-later” providers and the ease with which consumers have been able to tap credit-card lines. Goldman Sachs, a bank, ventured into consumer credit in 2019, helping to launch the Apple card. It now has a default rate of 3% over the past six months, unusually high even for sub-prime consumer lending. Ms Graseck of Morgan Stanley points out that, because this is an interest rate-shock driven cycle, trouble will probably first arrive in the loans that reprice to higher rates quickly: “Floating rate debt, like credit cards, is immediate, then commercial real estate, autos and eventually mortgages.”

在 2008 年因批评抵押导向的保险公司而名声大噪的 Michael Burry 担忧，”今天花明天的钱“的不安全的消费经济带来的增长已经花光了消费者的信用（和钱）。银行 Goldman Sachs 于 2019 年开始涉足消费贷款领域，帮助 Apple card 落地。在过去的 6 个月中，它的违约率已经达到了 3%，这个数值在次级消费市场贷款中十分不正常的高。来自 Morgan Stanley 的 Ms Graseck 指出，由于受到利率震惊周期（rate-shock driven cycle）的影响，最先感受到麻烦的很快会是借新债补旧债的人（the loans that reprice to higher rates quickly），原话是”浮动利率债，像信用卡这些，是马上能看到的，而接下来是商业地产，再到汽车，最终是所有抵押品“。

One of the fastest-growing parts of private credit has been that offered to software-service firms, notes Seth Bernstein, the boss of Alliance Bernstein, an asset manager. “These have been fantastic cash machines, because they have subscription models,” he explains. The cash flows they provide have been used to secure financing, meaning many firms are now highly leveraged. They have also never been tested in a downturn. Mr Bernstein compares the situation to the securitisation of housing debt, in that there is very little information or data available about the debt.

私人信用增长最快的部门是软件服务公司，说这话的是 Alliance Bernstein 资产管理公司的老大 Seth Bernstein。他解释道，这些人简直的美妙的印钞机器，因为他们有盈利模式。他们提供的现金流曾经为金融提供保障，这也意味着多数公司现在是高杠杆的。他们可没有经过什么”休克测试“（tested in a downturn）。Bernstein 与房屋债的保险进行了比较，我们对这些债务的已知信息和数据都很少。

It is companies more broadly that appear most at risk. They owe debts worth 80% of gdp, compared with 65% in 2007. A third of American corporate debt is rated bbb, the lowest investment-grade rating. Firms downgraded any further are no longer eligible for many investors’ portfolios. And defaults are now arriving. Bausch Health, a health-care provider, gave up the ghost on September 30th, taking the default rate for high-yield issuers above 1%, its highest since June 2020. Banks are struggling to offload debt they agreed to issue for corporate takeovers.

越来越多的公司开始显现危机。他们的债务规模达到了 GDP 的 80%，而在 2007 年这个数字还是 65%。有三分之一的美国公司债务被评级为 BBB，是投资指导的最低评级。要是再降低的话，就没有接受投资者投资的资格了。康复提供商 Bausch Health 就在 9 月 30 日提供了一个反而教材（gave up the ghost），它针对高收益投资的违约率达到了 1%，是自 2020 年 6 月以来的最高值。银行同意接管公司才算是挣扎着摆脱了债务。

Who holds these bad assets? Firms that have grown tremendously over the past fifteen years are the first place to look. Alternative assets, which include private equity, private debt, real estate and hedge funds, have grown from just 8% of total financial assets in 2006 to 15% now. They have taken paper losses of 11% on their investments this year, a much smaller fall than in the public markets. This might reflect sensible investment strategies—or an unwillingness to adjust to reality.

那么谁接手这些不良资产呢？过去 15 年时间里野蛮生长的公司是第一选择。而替代资产，包括私人股票、私人债务、地产和对冲基金这些，已经从 2006 年的占经济总量的 8% 达到了现在的 15%。今年，他们的纸面亏损达到投资总额的 11%，相比公开市场是很小的下挫。这也许预示着高度敏感的投资策略，或者是被迫的脱虚入实。（an unwillingness to adjust to reality）

Firms that have escaped the full weight of regulation are another place to look. The Financial Stability and Oversight Council (fsoc), an outfit established by America’s Treasury to watch important financial institutions, tried to claim oversight of the big insurance companies, including MetLife, aig and Prudential. But MetLife won a lawsuit to have the designation overturned, and the fsoc then rescinded its designations of the rest.

另外，脱离全面监管的公司是另一个选择。经济稳定和监督委员会（Financial Stability and Oversight Council），这是一家监督美国国债和重要经济机构的问题，试图开始监督大型保险公司，包括 MetLife，aig 和 Prudential。但 MetLife 打赢了推翻这项动议的官司，之后他们也撤回了对其他公司的动议。

If lots of investors are washed out, as they would be if a non-bank financial institution failed, well, “who cares?” quips one bank boss. Given reforms since the last financial crisis, it seems unlikely that governments would be called upon to intervene with bail-outs for institutions that are too big and too important to fail. The systemic institutions will survive another event like the blow-up of the hedge funds Archegos and lctm. But that does not make life any easier for central banks. It is their job to tighten policy enough to cool inflation without causing seriously disruptive activity in financial markets. And it is looking increasingly difficult to do both. ■

如果投资者被驱离了呢？当然当非银行金融机构失败后他们也会这样做。援引一位银行老板的原话，”管我啥事儿？“以上次金融危机以来的改革为鉴，想要让政府出面救市，来挽救那些过大而不能倒的机构是不太可能的。那些系统性机构能够从大型对冲基金，类似 Archegos 和 lctm ，的摧残中挺过来。但是央行的日子不会因此变得更好过。他们的责任就是收紧货币政策，从而控制通胀，并且不能过分地扰乱金融市场活动。现在看来，鱼和熊掌兼得的难度越来越大了。
