## 太长不看的段落大意

1. 英国家长望子成龙，将孩子送到高级私立学校接受教育，但这一切值得吗？
2. 在世界上的富裕国家，传统私立学校逐渐式微，他们拿到的政府补贴几乎腰斩，也容易受到政治上的诟病。
3. 有数据表明，昂贵的教育带来的（竞争）优势是明显的，这一点在美国的表现比英国更为突出。（一般认为英国比美国更加“受阶级支配”，但这个观点受到了上述事实的置疑）
4. 私立教育的规模在英国是 6.5 %，在美国在 9.0 %。
5. 英国私立教育的费用为 **£16,000 ($20,000)** 每年每人，是 1980s 时的 3 倍，是家庭收入中位数的一半。（作为参考：2022 年中国城镇居民，人均可支配收入是49,283元，中位数只有45,123元。想象一下， 4 万块钱供一个孩子上一年私立学校，在中国是不是有点科幻？）美国的数值是 $28,000 每年每人。
6. 提出问题，如何衡量私立教育的好坏，一方面是更好的成绩、更好的大学、更好的工作这一条链路；另一方面是得益于更有钱、勇气和智慧的家长，它们的占比几何，需要看下面的研究。
7. 2015 年的研究表明私立教育导致了劳动者在 25 岁时比同龄人的收入提高 17%，在年龄达到 42 岁时，则比同龄人的收入高了 21%（女性）和 35%（男性）。
8. 研究表明，这主要归功于私立学校的教学质量更高，量化来讲，它能够使一名 18 岁学生的成绩从 AAB 提高到 AAA。
9. 这“一点儿”助力足够私立教育的学生升入声望更好的大学。2021 年有超过一半的私立学校学生升入了英国的“Russell Group”大学。这些学生在高中的最后一年也会”投大学所好“地学习一些传统科目，从而更好地通过面试和选拔。
10. 但好日子一去不返，去年（指 2022 年）他们（指私立学校们）的毕业生只有 20% 升入 Russell Group 大学。
11. 在 2016 年，有 6% 的私立学校学生升入牛津或剑桥，而今跌落到 4%。（公立学校的比例为 2%）。升入本科的比例也从 20 年前的 43% 和 39% 跌落到了 32% 和 27%。
12. 美国的多样性导致不像英国这么单纯，有些人并不以学术水平选择学校，而是考虑宗教等因素。
13. 2018 年的研究表明美国的私立教育并没有给学生带来分数上的优势。
14. 但美国的大学更加看重“名校”。2021 年的研究表明美国大学中 34% 的本科生来自私立高中，而私立高中仅占全部高中生的 8.5%。
15. 草地绿与美元绿的冲突
16. 英国大学的学费“一视同仁”，而美国的顶尖大学在收费方面则“五花八门”，这使他们更加依赖于“赞助”。
17. 英国的私立学校毕业生开始外国留学，2016 年的比例是 4% 而今的比例是 6%，美国是最受欢迎的留学目的地。
18. 美国私立学校的日子要好过一些，由于一些种族、性别的政治辩论，由私立学校主导的教育项目能够得到政府拨款。
19. 然而，美国私立学校面临的问题是最高法院开始禁止“平权行动”类似的做法，而英国的私立学校面临着 18 个月后的工党执政，他们的优势和免税将受到影响。

**E**ton college can boast of educating more than a third of Britain’s 57 prime ministers over its 583 years. Less impressive is the fact that the number of its pupils winning places at the universities of Oxford or Cambridge fell by more than half between 2014 and the 2021-2022 school year. **Some parents pick private schools in the hope that their kids will benefit from more attention or less bullying**. Others bet that these institutions will lead to a **better education, higher grades and a place at a venerable university**. But soaring costs and changing university admissions policies are prompting discussion of **whether the crests and crenellations are worth it**.

**In many rich countries, traditional private schooling is in decline**. Across 30-odd members of the OECD, a club of mostly wealthy countries, the share of children in schools that **get less than half their funding from government fell from about 8% in 2000 to some 5% in 2018**. Private schools in Britain and America have fared better, and the debate over them remains particularly politically charged in both countries.

Recent evidence suggests that for most privately schooled children in Britain and those who attend elite private institutions in America, **the advantages of an expensive education remain robust**. The benefits are probably bigger in America than they are in Britain, at least for pupils sitting in the **swankiest private classrooms**. That is because their alumni continue to enjoy access to the best universities at rates which would cause a furore in the old country. That might surprise anyone who assumes that American society is less **ridden by class** than British society.

**Private schools in Britain serve around 6.5% of kids**, about the same share as they did in the 1960s. (Hockey sticks and rice pudding appeal across the ages.) **America’s ones teach about 9% of children**, a share that had held steady for a decade by the time of the covid-19 pandemic. In America about 75% of private-schoolers go to institutions with **religious affiliations** (a big chunk of which operate on fees that are similar to, or less than, per-pupil funding in government schools). But that country also has an exclusive subset of schools, often called **“independent” schools**, which most closely **mimic fee-paying** ones in Britain. These educate **less than 2% of American youngsters**.

Costs in Britain are among the highest in the world. **A family there can expect to cough up more than £16,000 ($20,000) a year to put one child through a private day school.** That is **three times** what they were paying in the 1980s; it is around half the median household income in Britain, whereas it was once one-fifth. Fees in America are lower on average, but also rocketed by 60% in the first decade of this century, according to the most recent good government data. The most snooty schools bill parents on average **$28,000 each year for a day pupil.**

Measuring what benefits flow from these outlays matters both to **critics of private schooling**—who accuse posh schools of perpetuating elites—and **to those who pay for it**. At first glance, the pay-offs are clear: all around the rich world privately educated pupils do **better in exams**, go to **better universities** and end up with **better-paid jobs**. But some of that success derives from advantages outside the classroom, such as having **wealthy, encouraging or intelligent parents**. Understanding the boost from private education involves comparing pupils’ fortunes with those of otherwise similar peers in government schools. Good research of this sort is easiest to find in Britain.

## ****Getting the abacus out****

By the time they turn 25 Britons with private education **earn 17% more than other workers from similar homes**, according to a study from 2015. The pay premium widens by the age of 42, according to earlier research, to around 21% for women and 35% for men. In part this is because privately schooled people are more likely to enter high-earning professions, such as finance. Alumni networks may help in this, **but peer pressure and parental expectations** probably play a big role, too.

![Untitled](Should%20you%20send%20your%20children%20to%20private%20school%207fdae98312b74b79952e74c0b1127e4b/Untitled%201.png)

A larger reason for higher incomes is because private-schoolers get **more and better academic qualifications than they otherwise would**. They enjoy a “modest” boost in test scores when compared with children from similar homes who enroll in government classrooms, reckons Francis Green at University College London. This advantage **accumulates** with every additional year they spend in private schooling. One study finds that the edge they enjoy by the time they are 18 is roughly the equivalent of **moving from grades of aab to aaa** (school-leavers on England’s academic track commonly take nationally standardised exams in three subjects).

The critical point is that even a modest boost in results can have **a big effect on the size of additional earnings**. That is because better grades might secure a pupil a slot at **a more prestigious university than they would have gone to otherwise**, or a slot at a university at all. In 2021 **more than half of privately educated pupils** who started a degree in Britain attended one of the 24 “Russell Group” universities (a club that includes most of the best ones). Such pupils are more likely to spend their last years at school studying the **tough, traditional subjects** that very selective universities most want to see on applications. They are also more likely to get extra help so as to ace interviews and admissions tests.

Private-schoolers **no longer** nab quite such unfair shares of top university places as they once did. They comprise around 18% of all pupils aged 16-19 in England, as well as about 25% of all those with top grades in school-leavers’ exams. Last year they were 20% of new undergraduates at Russell Group universities.

In 2016 about 6% of all private-schoolers who began a degree in Britain won places at the universities of Oxford or Cambridge; that share has since fallen to about 4% (it is around 2% for those from government schools). Last year private-schoolers made up 32% and 27% of the pair’s new British undergraduates, down from 43% and 39% a decade before. This shift has rocked the handful of elite private schools which once sent hordes of pupils to the two universities.

Picking apart the benefits of private education in America is difficult, because its schools are a more **motley bunch** than Britain’s. Since religion is banned from government schools, many pious parents pick private classes for reasons **other than academic performance alone**. Overall, evidence to suggest that America’s private-schoolers learn more than they would if they went to government schools is less secure than it is in Britain.

A study published in 2018 by two academics at the University of Virginia, Robert Pianta and Arya Ansari, analysed the test scores of 1,000 children who were born in the 1990s. It found that by age 15 the ones who attended American **private schools were getting no better grades**, after adjusting for their backgrounds. There is not much good research, however, singling out the extra benefits rich children gain from attending America’s subset of “independent” schools. But it is reasonable to think that they boost a child’s prospects by at least as much as their British cousins.

America’s universities welcome those from **grand schools with open arms**. In 2021 James Murphy of Education Reform Now, a think-tank in Washington, dc, collected data from 35 of America’s highest-ranked universities and liberal-arts colleges. He found that on average about **34% of their new undergraduates were educated in private high schools** (see chart). That is astonishing given that the private sector educates just 8.5% of American high-schoolers. Pupils from “independent” schools do brilliantly. The most recently published data suggest they made up about one-third of new undergraduates at Dartmouth and more than a quarter at Princeton. “Legacy” preference, whereby the **relatives of alumni get a leg-up in admissions**, may explain some of this. Nothing so brazenly unfair happens at British universities.

## ****Green lawns and greenbacks****

Money helps, too. Whereas English universities charge every domestic student the same tuition fees (though those from abroad pay more), America’s best universities vary the cost according to means. This allows exceptional pupils from poor backgrounds to study for little or nothing. But it also **gives universities good reason to keep in with dependable “feeder” schools**, full of clever pupils with ample wealth.

It follows that Britain’s private schools are **pointing more of their leavers overseas**. Last year about 6% of those who went to university chose to study abroad, up from 4% in 2016. America is the most popular destination. Its universities demand top grades, says Barnaby Lenon of the Independent School Council, which represents British private schools. But he adds that they also value non-academic achievements, such as those obtained through extra-curricular activities of a kind that private schools try hard to provide.

The **edge enjoyed by private-schoolers** is much less discussed in America than it is in Britain, in part because questions of race, rather than class, tend to take centre stage in debates about university admissions. Political battles that have broken out over the teaching of race, sex and history are **benefiting private providers**, in part because states are choosing to put money into private “school-choice” programmes. These involve local governments paying for some private-school places (commonly only for poor children and usually in the cheapest kinds of private institutions).

America may be **on the verge of change**, however. Imminent rulings from its Supreme Court could **ban the use of affirmative action** in university admissions. And if colleges and universities can no longer boost applicants from **underrepresented minority groups**, the advantages enjoyed by posh pupils may **receive greater scrutiny**. Private schools in Britain face a **bumpy ride**, too. The Labour Party, which looks likely to win power at elections due in the next 18 months, talks of **abolishing private schools’ charitable status and stripping them of tax breaks**. That could cause tuition fees to jump. Meanwhile, the paths to Oxford and Cambridge will keep narrowing. Expect a growing gang of Brits to head across the Atlantic. ■
